     <li>Theory and numerics of <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_theory_(mathematics)">optimal
     transport</a> especially its multimarginal extension as it appears
     in <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory">density
     functional theory</a> in quantum chemistry. Here is a partial
     overview of some contributions of mine on this subject:
     <ul>
     <li>In <span class="citation"
     data-cites="lelotteExternalDualCharge2024">[<a
     href="#ref-lelotteExternalDualCharge2024"
     role="doc-biblioref">1</a>]</span>, I proved that the Kantorovich
     potential for the multimarginal optimal transport with Coulomb cost
     is a superharmonic function, which can therefore be expressed as
     the electrostatic potential generated by a charge density. I then
     utilise this parametrisation to numerically solve the multimarginal
     optimal transport problem by discretising this charge density and
     solving the Kantorovich dual using classical optimisation and Monte
     Carlo-type methods.</li>
     <li>In <span class="citation"
     data-cites="lelotte_asymptotic_2022">[<a
     href="#ref-lelotte_asymptotic_2022"
     role="doc-biblioref">2</a>]</span>, I proved a conjecture regarding
     the asymptotics of the Kantorovich potential for repulsive
     transportation costs as commonly encountered in physics. This
     conjecture can be interpreted as a classical ionization conjecture
     for the <a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strictly-Correlated-Electrons_density_functional_theory">strictly-correlated
     electrons</a> system.</li>
     <li>At the present time, I am working (with Luca Nenna &amp;
     Virginie Ehrlacher) on several questions, among which the
     <em>regularity</em> of the <em>multimarginal</em> optimal transport
     with general costs (and implicitely on the existence of Monge
     transport maps in the multimarginal setting), as well as on the
     moment-constrained optimal transport and other numerical
     methods.</li>

     <li>Study of classical (and continuous) statistical physics systems
     such as <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09240">Coulomb and
     Riesz gases</a>, with a particular focus on the existence of the
     thermodynamic limit and phase transitions. Here is a contribution
     of mine on this subject:

     href="#ref-lelotte_phase_2023" role="doc-biblioref">3</a>]</span>,
     I showed numerical evidences that the one-dimensional Riesz gases
     exhibit phase transitions with respect the temperature in the
     long-range interaction regime, more precisely for the non-singular
     Riesz pair potential with exponent <span

     <li><a
     href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_order_reduction">Model
     order reduction</a> techniques for high-dimensional stochastic
     differential equations.

     <li>In the forthcoming paper <span class="citation"
     data-cites="lelievreProjectionStochasticDifferentialInpreparation">[<a
     href="#ref-lelievreProjectionStochasticDifferentialInpreparation"
     role="doc-biblioref">4</a>]</span> in collaboration with Virginie
     Ehrlacher, Tony Lelièvre and Julien Reygner, we explain how to
     build projection of stochastic differential equations onto
     submanifolds of <span
     class="math inline">ℝ<sup><em>d</em></sup></span> and develop
     numerical schemes for these objects that remain exactly onto the
     submanifold.

     <p>I was a teaching assistant at Université Paris-Dauphine. Some
     personal material for the fourth-year course <a
     href="https://turinici.com/analyse-numerique-evolution-m1-math">Analyse
     numérique: évolution</a> of Gabriel Turinici are available, namely
     a practical work (<a href="data/teaching/PW1.pdf">.pdf</a>, <a
     href="data/teaching/PW1_notebook.ipynb">.ipynb</a>) on the
     numerical integration of (stiff) ordinary differential equations.
     Although the material is fairly standard, I did manage to find an
     example of a differential equation <span
     class="math inline"><em>y</em>′ = <em>f</em>(<em>t</em>, <em>y</em>)</span>
     for a <em>non-Lipschitz</em> dynamics <span
     class="math inline"><em>f</em></span> which nevertheless admits an
     unique solution, and for which standard numerical schemes fail to
     converge. Another practical work (<a
     href="data/teaching/PW2.pdf">.pdf</a>, <a
     href="data/teaching/PW2_notebook.ipynb">.ipynb</a>) that deals with
     numerical integration of stochastic differential equations — with a
     somewhat long additional exercise that includes a remarkable result
     from random matrix theory and statistical physics.</p>
     <p>For the course <em>Analyse des équations aux dérivées
     partielles</em> for first year students of Ecole des Ponts, here
     are some (sketchy) <a

     (Sorbonne)</li>
     <li>I was invited at the occasion of the conference <em>On system
     of interacting particles</em> at the IHÉS (Bures-sur-Yvette), where
     I gave a talk on <a href="data/pres/ihes.pdf">The Riesz gases and

     class="math inline"><em>g</em>(<em>r</em>)</span> is depicted at
     decreasing temperatures, and we can observe that at sufficiently
     low temperature it becomes a periodic function (as in a crystal)
     whereas at high temperature it is monotonic (as in a fluid). On the

     solution verifies <span
     class="math inline">𝔼[<em>X</em><sub><em>t</em></sub>] ∈ 𝕊</span>

     important result in the study of the multimarginal optimal
