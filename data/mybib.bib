  abstract = {We provide numerical evidence for the existence of phase transitions with respect to the temperature in the one-dimensional Riesz gases with non-singular pair interaction, that is particles on the line interacting via the potential \$-|r|\textasciicircum\{-s\}\$, where \$s \textbackslash in (-1, 0)\$. Our numerics hint for the existence of two distinct phase transitions whose critical temperatures depend on \$s\$, namely a first transition which separates between a fluid and a quasisolid phase reminiscent of the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, and a second transition below which freezing occurs and the system is in a solid phase. We determine the phase diagram with respect to \$s\$ and the temperature \$T\$, which we find to be consistent with the known (or expected) results on the 1D Coulomb gas (\$s = -1\$), known to be a solid at all temperature, and the Dyson log--gas (\$s = 0\$) which exhibits a BKT transition at \$T = 1/2\$ and which is believed to be a fluid at all positive temperature.},
